name: gpact-investigate
description: |
  Systematic debugging with root cause investigation. Four phases: investigate,
  analyze, hypothesize, implement. Iron Law: no fixes without root cause.
  Use when asked to "debug this", "fix this bug", "why is this broken",
  "investigate this error", or "root cause analysis".
  Proactively invoke this skill (do NOT debug directly) when the user reports
  errors, 500 errors, stack traces, unexpected behavior, "it was working
  yesterday", or is troubleshooting why something stopped working. (gstack)

The plugin root is three directories above this loaded SKILL.md. Resolve that absolute path from the skill file location and set `GSTACK_ROOT` to it in every shell block. It contains `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and `bin/gstack-skill-start`.
<!-- AUTO-GENERATED from SKILL.md.tmpl — do not edit directly -->
<!-- Regenerate: bun run gen:skill-docs -->
> **Safety Advisory:** This skill includes safety checks that verify file edits are within the allowed scope boundary before applying, and verify file writes are within the allowed scope boundary before applying. When using this skill, always pause and verify before executing potentially destructive operations. If uncertain about a command's safety, ask the user for confirmation before proceeding.


## Start /gpact-investigate

```bash
_G="$GSTACK_ROOT"
"$_G/bin/gpact-plugin-init" || exit 1
"$_G/bin/gstack-skill-start" --skill "investigate" --model "gpt" --parent-pid "$PPID" || echo 'SKILL_START: unavailable'
```

Reuse printed `GSTACK_BIN`; shell variables reset. Missing `GSTACK_CONTRACT` or `SKILL_START_PROTO: 1` blocks protected /gpact-investigate steps. If `SESSION_KIND` is absent, treat `SESSION_KIND` as `interactive`; do NOT assume Conductor. Onboarding/telemetry: DEFERRED to the next healthy run. Keep `SESSION_ID` and `TEL_START`.

## Shared contract

Read the printed `GSTACK_CONTRACT` file before acting. It owns common permissions and safety.

## Model-Specific Behavioral Patch (gpt)

The following nudges are tuned for the gpt model family. They are
**subordinate** to skill workflow, STOP points, AskUserQuestion gates, plan-mode
safety, and /gpact-ship review gates. If a nudge below conflicts with skill instructions,
the skill wins. Treat these as preferences, not rules.

**Completion bias.** Do not end your turn with a partial solution when the full
solution is reachable. If you encounter an error, debug it. If a test fails, fix it.
If something is ambiguous, make your best judgment and proceed — don't stop and ask
unless you're genuinely blocked.

**Prefer doing over listing.** When you'd be tempted to write "you could also try X,
Y, or Z," try the best option yourself. Pick, execute, report results.

**No preamble.** Skip "Great question!", "Let me help with that", and restating the
user's request. Start with the work.

**AskUserQuestion is NOT preamble.** The "No preamble" and "Prefer doing over listing"
rules above do NOT apply to AskUserQuestion content. When you invoke AskUserQuestion,
the user is about to make a decision — they need context, not terseness. Always emit
the full format from the preamble's AskUserQuestion Format section:

1. **Re-ground** (project + branch + task — 1-2 sentences).
2. **Simplify (ELI10)** — explain what's happening in plain English a 16-year-old could
   follow. Concrete stakes, not abstract tradeoffs. Non-negotiable; this is NOT preamble.
3. **Recommend** — `RECOMMENDATION: Choose [X] because [one-line reason]` on its own
   line. Never omit this line. Never collapse it into the options list.
4. **Options** — lettered `A) B) C)` with Completeness scores (coverage-differentiated)
   or the "options differ in kind" note (kind-differentiated).

If you find yourself about to present an AskUserQuestion without the Simplify/ELI10
paragraph, without a RECOMMENDATION line, or by just listing options and asking "which
one?" — stop, back up, and emit the full format. The user will ask you to do it anyway,
so do it the first time.

**Reminder: subordination applies.** When a skill workflow says STOP, stop. When the
skill asks via AskUserQuestion, that is the wait-for-user gate, not an ambiguity.
Completion bias does not override safety gates.

# /gpact-investigate

## Outcome
`/gpact-investigate` is finished only when this is true: Systematic debugging with root cause investigation. Four phases: investigate, analyze, hypothesize, implement. Iron Law: no fixes without root cause. Use when asked to "debug this", "fix this bug", "why is this broken", "investigate this error", or "root cause analysis". Proactively invoke this skill (do NOT debug directly) when the user reports errors, 500 errors, stack traces, unexpected behavior, "it was working yesterday", or is troubleshooting why something stopped working. (gstack) Verify that outcome for `/gpact-investigate`, then stop.

## Constraints
Stay on the `/gpact-investigate` job. Do not expand `/gpact-investigate` into adjacent cleanup or speculative hardening. Do not start another gstack skill unless the tool contract for `/gpact-investigate` says to hand off. Do not read `/gpact-investigate` sections/ unless the user asks for the legacy checklist.

## Stop
Stop `/gpact-investigate` when the outcome above is verified, or when `/gpact-investigate` is blocked on a destructive, irreversible, or product-defining fact. If blocked, ask that decision with a recommendation and wait for the answer. Then finish `/gpact-investigate` or stop.

## Tool contract
Find the root cause before changing code. State the hypothesis, the check that would falsify it, and the result. A fix without a cause is not done.

```bash
S="$HOME/.agents/skills/gstack/freeze/bin/check-freeze.sh"
[ -x "$S" ] && exec bash "$S"; exit 0
_FREEZE_SCRIPT="$HOME/.agents/skills/gstack/freeze/bin/check-freeze.sh"
[ -x "$_FREEZE_SCRIPT" ] && echo "FREEZE_AVAILABLE" || echo "FREEZE_UNAVAILABLE"
```
