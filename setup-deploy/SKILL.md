## When to invoke this skill

Detects your deploy
platform (Fly.io, Render, Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, GitHub Actions, custom),
production URL, health check endpoints, and deploy status commands. Writes
the configuration to CLAUDE.md so all future deploys are automatic.
Use when: "setup deploy", "configure deployment", "set up land-and-deploy",
"how do I deploy with gstack", "add deploy config".

## Start /setup-deploy

```bash
_G="$HOME/.claude/skills/gstack"
_R=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
[ -n "$_R" ] && [ -x "$_R/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-skill-start" ] && _G="$_R/.claude/skills/gstack"
"$_G/bin/gstack-skill-start" --skill "setup-deploy" --model "claude" --parent-pid "$PPID" || echo 'SKILL_START: unavailable'
```

Reuse printed `GSTACK_BIN`; shell variables reset. Missing `GSTACK_CONTRACT` or `SKILL_START_PROTO: 1` blocks protected /setup-deploy steps. If `SESSION_KIND` is absent, treat `SESSION_KIND` as `interactive`; do NOT assume Conductor. Onboarding/telemetry: DEFERRED to the next healthy run. Keep `SESSION_ID` and `TEL_START`.

## Shared contract

Read the printed `GSTACK_CONTRACT` file before acting. It owns common permissions and safety.

## Model-Specific Behavioral Patch (claude)

The following nudges are tuned for the claude model family. They are
**subordinate** to skill workflow, STOP points, AskUserQuestion gates, plan-mode
safety, and /ship review gates. If a nudge below conflicts with skill instructions,
the skill wins. Treat these as preferences, not rules.

**Todo-list discipline.** When working through a multi-step plan, mark each task
complete individually as you finish it. Do not batch-complete at the end. If a task
turns out to be unnecessary, mark it skipped with a one-line reason.

**Think before heavy actions.** For complex operations (refactors, migrations,
non-trivial new features), briefly state your approach before executing. This lets
the user course-correct cheaply instead of mid-flight.

**Dedicated tools over Bash.** Prefer Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep over shell
equivalents (cat, sed, find, grep). The dedicated tools are cheaper and clearer.

# /setup-deploy

## Outcome
`/setup-deploy` is finished only when this is true: Configure deployment settings for /land-and-deploy. Detects your deploy platform (Fly.io, Render, Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, GitHub Actions, custom), production URL, health check endpoints, and deploy status commands. Writes the configuration to CLAUDE.md so all future deploys are automatic. Use when: "setup deploy", "configure deployment", "set up land-and-deploy", "how do I deploy with gstack", "add deploy config". Verify that outcome for `/setup-deploy`, then stop.

## Constraints
Stay on the `/setup-deploy` job. Do not expand `/setup-deploy` into adjacent cleanup or speculative hardening. Do not start another gstack skill unless the tool contract for `/setup-deploy` says to hand off. Do not read `/setup-deploy` sections/ unless the user asks for the legacy checklist.

## Stop
Stop `/setup-deploy` when the outcome above is verified, or when `/setup-deploy` is blocked on a destructive, irreversible, or product-defining fact. If blocked, ask that decision with a recommendation and wait for the answer. Then finish `/setup-deploy` or stop.

## Tool contract
Detect the host (Fly, Render, Vercel, Netlify, Heroku, GitHub Actions, or a custom command). Write the production URL, health check, and deploy command where `/land-and-deploy` reads them.
