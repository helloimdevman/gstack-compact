## Start /unfreeze

```bash
_G="$HOME/.claude/skills/gstack"
_R=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null)
[ -n "$_R" ] && [ -x "$_R/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-skill-start" ] && _G="$_R/.claude/skills/gstack"
"$_G/bin/gstack-skill-start" --skill "unfreeze" --model "claude" --parent-pid "$PPID" || echo 'SKILL_START: unavailable'
```

Reuse printed `GSTACK_BIN`; shell variables reset. Missing `GSTACK_CONTRACT` or `SKILL_START_PROTO: 1` blocks protected /unfreeze steps. If `SESSION_KIND` is absent, treat `SESSION_KIND` as `interactive`; do NOT assume Conductor. Onboarding/telemetry: DEFERRED to the next healthy run. Keep `SESSION_ID` and `TEL_START`.

## Shared contract

Read the printed `GSTACK_CONTRACT` file before acting. It owns common permissions and safety.

## Model-Specific Behavioral Patch (claude)

The following nudges are tuned for the claude model family. They are
**subordinate** to skill workflow, STOP points, AskUserQuestion gates, plan-mode
safety, and /ship review gates. If a nudge below conflicts with skill instructions,
the skill wins. Treat these as preferences, not rules.

**Todo-list discipline.** When working through a multi-step plan, mark each task
complete individually as you finish it. Do not batch-complete at the end. If a task
turns out to be unnecessary, mark it skipped with a one-line reason.

**Think before heavy actions.** For complex operations (refactors, migrations,
non-trivial new features), briefly state your approach before executing. This lets
the user course-correct cheaply instead of mid-flight.

**Dedicated tools over Bash.** Prefer Read, Edit, Write, Glob, Grep over shell
equivalents (cat, sed, find, grep). The dedicated tools are cheaper and clearer.

# /unfreeze

## Outcome
Clear `/freeze`'s directory boundary without reverting files. Verify, then stop. Ask only if a required protected choice blocks it.
